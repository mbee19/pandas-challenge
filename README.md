Challenge 4 for Morgan Bee

In this challenge, I worked with my classmate Kiley Karecki. Together, we used all of the class activities to write our code for this assignment. In order to check errors and get ourselves unstuck, we consulted the Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT.
Code that I pulled directly from ChatGPT was changing previously formatted variables back into floats, in the Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Size, and Scores by School Type sections. We learned the .nunique() function from Xpert Learning Assistant and the .round() function from ChatGPT. 

In the Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Size, and Scores by School Type sections, there are Warnings that pop up when you run the code, but the code still runs. In class, we were told to disregard these warnings and continue on.
